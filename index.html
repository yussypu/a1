            <h3>A Thousand Splendid suns</h3>
            <p>
                Like diamonds and roses hidden under bomb rubble, this is a story of intense beauty and strength buried
                under the surface of the cruel and capricious life imposed upon two Afghani women.
                <br><em>She remembered Nana saying once that each snowflake was a sigh heaved by an aggrieved woman
                    somewhere in the world. That all the sighs drifted up the sky, gathered into clouds, then broke into
                    tiny pieces that fell silently on the people below. As a reminder of how people like us suffer,
                    she'd
                    said. How quietly we endure all that falls upon us.</em><br>
                Staggeringly beautiful and deep and rich and sad and frightening and infuriating. Buy the book and read
                it.
